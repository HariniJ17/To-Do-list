Objective: The objective of the "To-Do List" project is to develop a functional web application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The application should enable users to add, edit, and delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed. The primary goal is to enhance productivity and organization for the users.

Technologies Used:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
Purpose: Structuring the content of the web page.
Usage: Creating the layout of the to-do list, including forms for adding new tasks and lists for displaying existing tasks.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
Purpose: Styling the web page to make it visually appealing.
Usage: Designing the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of the to-do list application. CSS helps ensure that the application is responsive and looks good on various devices.

JavaScript:
Purpose: Adding interactivity and dynamic features to the web application.
Usage: Handling user actions such as adding new tasks, editing or deleting existing tasks, and marking tasks as completed. JavaScript is also used for storing and retrieving tasks from local storage, so the tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.
